# 🚒 London Fire Brigade — Operational & Geospatial Analysis

End-to-end data analysis project based on public London Fire Brigade data, aiming to evaluate operational performance and optimize emergency response.

## 🎯 Business objectives
- Measure response time performance across incidents and areas
- Identify spatial hotspots and high-risk zones
- Support operational decision-making with data-driven insights

## 📁 Dataset
- Public London Fire Brigade incident data
- Spatio-temporal operational records (calls, turnout, travel, response times)

## 🔄 Data pipeline
1. Data ingestion & schema checks
2. Cleaning & data quality controls
3. KPI computation & feature engineering
4. Geospatial analysis & modeling
5. Export for Power BI dashboarding

## 📊 Dashboard (Power BI)
Interactive dashboard including:
- Response time KPIs
- Incident distribution by area
- Hotspot maps
- Temporal trends

*(Screenshots to be added)*

## 🛠️ Tech stack
- Python (pandas, GeoPandas, scikit-learn)
- SQL
- Power BI

## 📌 Key outcomes
- Identification of response-time slow zones
- Strong seasonal and time-of-day effects
- Operational scenarios to reduce median response time
